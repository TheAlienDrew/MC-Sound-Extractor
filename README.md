# MC-Sound-Extractor

Just a conversion of the https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory#Extracting_Minecraft_Music script for Mac, but for Linux, and Windows WSL.

Changes coming soon:
  - The Windows WSL version will be replaced with a DOS batch file
  - Going to merge the [Mac](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory#Extracting_Minecraft_Music_On_Mac) and Linux script together so it can run on either system
