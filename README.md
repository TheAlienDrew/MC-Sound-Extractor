# MC-Sound-Extractor

COMPATIBILITY: Windows (WSL), Mac [see here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory#Extracting_Minecraft_Music_On_Mac), & Linux!

Changes coming soon:
  - Going to figure out a way to make a Windows batch script to replace the WSL one (for users that don't use WSL)
  - Going to merge the Windows WSL, Mac, and Linux scripts together so it can run on either system
