# MC-Sound-Extractor

COMPATIBILITY: Windows (WSL), Mac [see here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory#Extracting_Minecraft_Music_On_Mac), & Linux!

Changes coming soon:
  - The Windows WSL version will be replaced with a DOS batch file
  - Going to merge the Mac and Linux script together so it can run on either system
